## Introduction ##

In this [notebook](https://github.com/KuZa91/CryptoAnalysis_of_a_Vigenere_cipher/blob/main/VigenereCipherCryptoanalysis.ipynb), we are gonna decipher a message that we know was encrypted by using a [Vigenere cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher). The message that are going to consider is as follows : \

We are gonna start our analysis by trying to find the lenght of the key, which is probably the most important step in order to properly solve a Vigenere Cipher.
Knowing the lenght of the key, allow us to decompose the original encoded text in a subset of $n$ messages encoded trough a common [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), where $n$ is equal to the lenght of the key.
The Caesar ciphers, can be easily decrypted trough [brute force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack), as each subset would only have 26 possible values for the key value, however, in our analysis we are gonna implement a [frequentist analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference) in order to properly estimate the value of the key for the various subsets.
The [notebook](https://github.com/KuZa91/CryptoAnalysis_of_a_Vigenere_cipher/blob/main/VigenereCipherCryptoanalysis.ipynb) procedure, can be easily used to decrypt any other message encrypted trough use of a Vigenere cipher, however, as some of the conjectures used in this approach can lead to misleading results, human supervision through the steps of the analysis is still greatly suggested in spite of considering the [notebook](https://github.com/KuZa91/CryptoAnalysis_of_a_Vigenere_cipher/blob/main/VigenereCipherCryptoanalysis.ipynb) as an automatic solver !

## Analysis Details ##

In order to find the lenght of the key used to encrypt the message, we are gonna get a first rough estimation on the number of alphabets used on the message by mean of the [Index of Coincidence (IC)](http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/text-characterisation/index-coincidence/).
This information, together with an analysis based on the use of the [Kasiski Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination), would setup our guess for the lenght of the key.
Once the key lenght is known, we are gonna first give a guess on one of the value of the key by considering the subtext having value of the $IC$ closest to the one known for the english text, by looking at the relative position of the frequency peaks for the characters of this subtext, and comparing with the position of the peaks in standard english texts, we see that even by eye it is possible to guess the right value for this subtext key.
This point, however, is only usefull in order to understand the principle that describe the decryption procedure, as the correct values of the key would then be found by using the [Mutual Index of Coincidence (MIC)](https://www.jfricker.com/blog/cryptanalysis-of-the-vigenere-cipher/) in relation to the frequencies of the english language. Once the correct values of the key is found, the encrypted message will be recomposed in order to obtain our solution !
